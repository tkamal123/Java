This part of the coursework requires the implementation of a simple mushroom database program. 
The program, housed in the MushroomDatabase.java class, allows users to input mushroom records, store them in arrays, and perform various operations such as listing all records,
searching by color or edibility, and quitting the program.
Key points to note about the program's behavior:
Users are prompted to specify the number of mushroom records they wish to input.
For each record, users enter the name, color, and edibility of the mushroom.
Data is stored in three separate arrays: one for names, one for colors, and one for edibilities.
Edibility is stored as a boolean value (true for edible, false for not edible).
After inputting data, users are given options to list all entries, list entries by color or edibility, or quit the program.
The program continues to prompt the user for actions until they choose to exit.
Coding requirements include properly handling user input, storing data in arrays, implementing loop structures for program flow, and providing appropriate output based on user choices.
The program should follow the specified behavior and structure outlined in the instructions to fulfill the coursework requirements effectively.
