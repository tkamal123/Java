The assignment involves, assists students in assessing their progress in their degree programs based on their marks for four courses.
Progression rules differ for BSc Computer Science and BSc Computer Systems students, and grades are determined based on specific mark thresholds.

To keep things simple, you only need to consider that:
• Students are in the first semester of their first year
• All students take the four courses F27SA, F27ID, F27PX and F17LP
• Students are on either the BSc Computer Science or BSc Computer Systems programme.
To determine whether a student has achieved the marks they need to proceed, your programme
will have to implement some decision logic that takes into account both the degree the student is
studying on and the marks they have achieved in each course. The progression rules are:
• BSc Computer Science students require:
o at least a D in F27SA, F27ID and F17LP
o at least an E in F27PX
• BSc Computer Systems students require:
o at least a D in F27SA and F27ID
o at least an E in F27PX and F17LP
You also need to know that:
• Grade D is awarded for a mark greater than or equal to 40% and less than 50%.
• Grade E is awarded for a mark greater than or equal to 30% and less than 40%.
