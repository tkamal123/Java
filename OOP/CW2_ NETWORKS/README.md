Upcasting and Downcasting:
Draw a class inheritance tree with the following structure:
Person
Teacher
Student
PhDStudent
Explain the structure during the marking session.
Determine the legality of the following assignments and provide explanations:
a) Person p1 = new Student();
b) PhDStudent phd1 = new Student();
Implement the class structure in Java:
Create the class structure in Java based on the provided hierarchy.
Confirm the legality of the assignments in task 1 by attempting them in the Java implementation.
Show the implementation to a lab helper for marking.
Introducing Deeper Hierarchies:
Refactor the existing code to introduce two new classes: EventPost and CommentedPost.
Implement the following inheritance hierarchy:
Post
EventPost
CommentedPost
Ensure the output remains similar to before, avoiding code duplication and utilizing dynamic method lookup.
Create an instance of EventPost in StartNetwork.java and add it to news.
Verify that the EventPost with all its content is printed correctly when running the network.
