A) To expand the translation system, a new language (e.g., French) is integrated alongside the existing English-to-German translations.
At least two words are added to the new translation map, ensuring some overlap with the English-to-German map and introducing unique translations as well.
In the translate method, if the English word entered by the user exists in both the English-to-German and the new language map, both translation results are displayed to the user, prefixed with the name of the language.
This necessitates altering the translate method to accommodate translations from English to all languages where a translation exists, while still providing an error response if no translation is found.
B) To prevent repeating the same error response twice in a row, a mechanism is introduced to remember the previous index that was selected.
This ensures that consecutive error responses differ, enhancing user experience and feedback.
C) Emulating the functionality of Google Translate, a third language (e.g., Spanish) is incorporated into the system.
Spanish-to-English translations are added to facilitate translation from Spanish into other languages.
The translate method is adjusted to handle Spanish input, retrieve the corresponding English translation, and use it to look up translations in other languages.
This enables translation from Spanish into all known languages in the system, similar to the process followed by Google Translate.
